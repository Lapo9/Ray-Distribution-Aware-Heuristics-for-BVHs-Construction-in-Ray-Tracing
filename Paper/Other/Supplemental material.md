# Supplemental Material of the paper *Ray Distribution Aware Heuristics for Bounding Volume Hierarchies Construction for Ray Tracing*

## GitHub repository of the C++ framework (builder and analyzer)
https://github.com/Lapo9/Ray-Distribution-Aware-Heuristics-for-BVHs-Construction-in-Ray-Tracing

It contains :
- The source code of the C++ framwork cited in the paper
- Some csv and json files containing the experimental results
- My Master Thesis this paper is extracted from

The material in the repo may change or be better organized in the future, but it is still possible to go back in time and see all the commits.

## GitHub repository of the C# Unity visualizer
https://github.com/Lapo9/BVHs-Visualizer

It contains a Unity project where it is possible to pass as input a json file created by our C++ anayzer and obtain the BVHs and octrees as output. It works for lowpoly scenes, but it is very slow for scenes with more than 5000 triangles.

The material in the repo may change or be better organized in the future, but it is still possible to go back in time and see all the commits.

## C++ framework Doxygen documentation

It will be improved in the future.
