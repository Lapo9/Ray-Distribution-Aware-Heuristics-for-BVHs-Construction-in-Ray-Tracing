- maxLeafProbability: PAH quality and construction speedup
- maxNonFallbackLevels: PAH quality and construction speedup
- splitPlaneQualityThreshold and maxChildrenFatherHitProbabilityRation: PAH quality and construction speedup
- octree maxLevel: PAH quality and construction speedup
- octree conservativeApproach: problems it poses
- Sponza scene
- try with more than one influence area
- try with influence area but rays that do not come from that direction: show PAH doesn't work
- try manual big primitives splitting: PAH quality
- post-calculate projected overlapping amount (it may explain why it doesn't work with point influence areas)
